PSUEDOCODE FOR THE TRIVIA GAME:

USING THE SKELETON CREATED IN THE HTML, I LOGICALLY NEED TO DO THE FOLLOWING:

- CREATE THE VARIABLES FOR THE VALUES OF THE INDEPENDENT TRUE/ FALSE BUTTONS FOR EACH QUESTION:
    This can probably be accomplished more efficiently with a function or array since the process repeats.


- CREATE THE FUNCTIONS FOR THE "ONCLICK" FUNCTIONS SO THE TIMER STARTS
- CREATE THE FUNCTIONS FOR THE SCORE, SO THE SCORE IS STORED IN A VARIABLE WHEN CORRECT,
    CREATE A VARIABLE TO STORE THE VALUE WHEN THE ANSWER IS INCORRECT.
    CREATE A VARIABLE FOR THE TOTAL SCORE TO BE DISPLAYED AT THE END OR END OF TIME.
    CREATE AN EVENT HANDLER TO STOP EVERYTHING AND TALLY SCORE IF THE TIMER REACHES 120 SECONDS.
- DISPLAY THE SCORE AND TIME ON THE PAGE FOR THE USER TO SEE.
